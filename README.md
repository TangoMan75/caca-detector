üí© Caca Detector - Catch the Code Slip-Ups Before Your Users Do
===============================================================

<img src="./images/pile_of_poo_notification.png" align="left" width="96" style="margin-right: 1em">

**Caca Detector** is a Chrome extension that displays a notification when it detects the word _"caca"_ on a web page.
A project inspired by a good friend of mine. üòâ

</br>

üöÄ Features
-----------

- üí© Scans web pages for the word _"caca"_.
- üí© Displays a _"pile of poo"_ emoji on the page and changes the extension icon when a match is found.
- üí© Real-time alerts when _"caca"_ appears on any page.
- üí© Great for teams that value clean, professional code.
- üí© Guaranteed to cause at least one awkward chuckle.

ü§î Why "Caca Detector"?
-----------------------

Developers are human. And code is often frustrating.

And sometimes we leave behind little messages like _"here"_, _"test"_, or _"foobar"_ in the code instead of using the _"console.log()"_ function or debugging tools.

And, in moments of peak frustration, **"caca"**.

The problem is when we forget to remove those messages, and they end up in production. Which inevitably causes a rather embarrassing comedic effect. You wouldn't believe how often this happens !!!

This Chrome extension scans webpages for those accidental gems and gently notifies you when they've slipped into production. Whether you're a quality control crusader or just appreciate the comedy of human error, **Caca Detector** is here to save face (and maybe your job).

1. Go to the [Caca Detector](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/caca-detector/bdignjhbkmhmekpkdgdhgjgegghpbcde) page on the Chrome Web Store.

3. A _"pile of poo"_ emoji will appear on the page, click on it to make it go away.
